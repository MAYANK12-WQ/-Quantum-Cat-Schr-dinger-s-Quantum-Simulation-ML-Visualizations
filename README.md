# -Quantum-Cat-Schr-dinger-s-Quantum-Simulation-ML-Visualizations
Welcome to **Quantum Cat** – a groundbreaking project that brings together quantum mechanics, machine learning, and hyper-futuristic data visualizations in one interactive package. This project simulates Schrödinger’s famous thought experiment using synthetic quantum data, advanced ML models, and dynamic, animated charts.
